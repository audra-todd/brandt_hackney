Professional website for cinematographer/director of photography, Brandt Hackney.

PURPOSE:
Cinematographer Brandt Hackney was interested in a website that could showcase some of his work and allow film groups to contact him for hire.  He is moving from Orlando, a film industry market where he was easily getting work by word of mouth reference.  Orlando lost its film incentives while Kentucky enacted new tax initiatives.  In moving to his new location, he doesn't already have the connections to keep him in work, so it's imparative that people can quickly get an idea of his talent and dedication.

I wanted to make sure that in using high quality images for the site, we weren't slowing down loading times etc.
